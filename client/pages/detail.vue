          Amazon's new thin client looks just like a Fire TV Cube…and that's by
          design. The company this morning announced the launch of new $195
          devices that allow enterprise users to access virtual desktop
          environments, like Amazon WorkSpaces, over the internet. The devices
          are housed in Fire TV Cube hardware — a decision Amazon made to
          leverage existing expertise from the arm of the retail giant that
          makes streaming media players.<br /><br />

          The company explained its decision to build new hardware came from
          customer feedback about wanting to lower I.T. spending by replacing
          desktops and laptops with less expensive hardware. Today, many of
          Amazon's enterprise customers log on to virtual desktops based on AWS
          End User Computing Services, like Amazon WorkSpaces, WorkSpaces Web,
          or Amazon AppStream, but they tend to do so over desktops or laptops
          that cost their employer $600 to $1200 each, Amazon says.<br /><br />

          The new thin clients will dramatically undercut that pricing, though
          they will not have all the capabilities of a dedicated PC. Still, the
          idea was to offer customers a way to be up and running with new
          end-user hardware more quickly and at a more cost-effective price
          point. And when it came time to design the hardware, Amazon decided
          not to reinvent the wheel.<br /><br />

          "We have an entire division in our company that makes devices
          already," said Melissa Stein, director of product for End User
          Computing at AWS, who oversaw the Amazon WorkSpaces Thin Client
          project, in an announcement about the new technology. "Combining the
          expertise from the Amazon Devices group with logistics from Amazon
          Business and the power of the AWS Cloud is a strong combination for
          customers," she added.<br /><br />

          Though Stein's team built a new software stack for the device, they
          didn't have to build the new hardware, which allowed them to keep
          costs down.<br /><br />

          The resulting thin client offers low-cost computing by offloading much
          of its processing power to the cloud, specifically the AWS Cloud. That
          means the device itself does not store data and only runs approved
          software deployed by I.T., for added security. If a device is lost or
          stolen, company data remains secure in the cloud.<br /><br />

          But unlike the Fire TV Cube, where consumers would connect their
          entertainment devices, like a TV, the thin client's USB and HDMI ports
          support the connection of peripherals like dual monitors, a mouse, a
          keyboard, a camera, a headset, and more. Inside, the team built new
          firmware and software, including an operating system for employees to
          access their company's cloud applications.<br /><br />
